    </ul>

  <p>With the books closed, Jordan is one of the few individuals in basketball who, under consensus, needs nothing else to prove. The argument is strong ang solid, but is always welcoming of challenger and those who dare to climb that hill of greatness. </p>

<div class="content">
  <h1><u>So, Who is the GOAT?</u></h1>
  <p>Now that we have a brief idea of their careers, a quick disclaimer, first, take all those accolades with a grain of salt. Believe me when I say they do not tell the entire story, the impact to the people can only be synthesized if you have watched them play the sport.</p>

  <center>

   </center>

  <p>Career wise, from the direct comparison of career accolades, Jordan definitely wins the debate. However, from a player and team perspective, when players envision the perfect body type and skillset of the best basketball player that there can be, James wins this argument. Again, as mentioned earlier, it is still a bit unfair for James as his story is not yet done, with a few more years left, he may possibly surpass these accolades, assuming no untoward incidences will occur like injuries. In the end of the day, as basketball fans first, we should appreciate the greatness of both people. The people dramatize the debate so much that the public forgets to simply appreciate their contributions to basketball. Appreciate and witness greatness.</p>
